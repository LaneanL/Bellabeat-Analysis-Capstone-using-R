   Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.
Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around
the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with
knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly
positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
   Thirty-three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits
